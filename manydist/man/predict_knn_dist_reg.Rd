\title{Predict from a KNN-distance model (regression)}
\usage{
predict_knn_dist_reg(object, new_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A `knn_dist` object created by `fit_knn_dist()`.}

\item{new_data}{A data frame or matrix. Either:
- precomputed distances to training points (if `dist_fun` is NULL), or
- raw predictors to be passed to `dist_fun`.}
}
\description{
Used by parsnip for regression mode (`type = "numeric"`).
Supports two modes:
- `dist_fun` is NULL  →  `new_data` is assumed to already be a
  distance matrix (e.g., produced by `step_mdist()`).
- `dist_fun` is a function  →  distances are computed as
  `dist_fun(x = object$x, new_data = new_data, ...)`.
