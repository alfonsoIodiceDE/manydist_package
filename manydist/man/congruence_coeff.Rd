\title{Congruence coefficient between two configurations}
\usage{
congruence_coeff(L1, L2)
}
\arguments{
\item{L1}{A numeric matrix or data frame (rows = observations)}

\item{L2}{A numeric matrix or data frame with the same number of rows as \code{L1}}
}
\value{
A scalar in \eqn{[-1,1]} measuring similarity between the two configurations.
}
\description{
Computes the congruence coefficient between two data configurations
using the Frobenius inner product of their pairwise distance matrices.
}
\details{
The congruence coefficient is defined as
\deqn{
  \frac{\langle D_1, D_2 \rangle_F}
       {\sqrt{\langle D_1, D_1 \rangle_F \langle D_2, D_2 \rangle_F}}
}
where \eqn{D_1} and \eqn{D_2} are the pairwise distance matrices derived from
\code{L1} and \code{L2}.
