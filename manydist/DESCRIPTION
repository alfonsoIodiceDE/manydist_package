Description: Tools for computing unbiased distance measures for datasets containing 
    mixed-type variables (numerical and categorical). The package implements a general 
    formulation ensuring multivariate additivity and commensurability, so that variables 
    contribute equally to the overall distance regardless of type, scale, or distribution. 
    Supported measures include Gower, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances, as well as 
    categorical dissimilarities such as simple matching, Eskin, occurrence frequency, 
    and association-based distances. The package provides variable scaling methods 
    (standard deviation, range, robust range, and principal component scaling) and 
    supports both independent and association-based category dissimilarities. Bias 
    corrections for differences in variable type, distribution, and number of categories 
    are included. Methods are based on van de Velden et al. (2024) 
    <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2411.00429>.
